# QUBE - Quantum chemistry Utility for Benchmark Evaluation

QUBE (Quantum chemistry Utility for Benchmark Evaluation) is a Fortran-based tool designed for extracting energies from the output files of quantum chemistry calculations for large benchmark sets. 
QUBE utilizes reference energies for statistical evaluation and comparison of the results obtained from the benchmark sets. 
For that, QUBE uses .res-files as an input, which contain the benchmark structure and stoichiometry, as well as the reference energies. 

With QUBE, users can efficiently evaluate the accuracy and reliability of quantum chemistry calculations, aiding in the development of new methods and algorithms.
